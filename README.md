# Otti - Big O Testing Tool!

Currently configured to test just the fulcrum finding functions, to run, go into your projects directory and:

`git clone git@github.com:Twitchkidd/otti.git`
`cd otti`
`yarn && node server.js`

Then open another terminal tab and:

`cd visualizer && yarn start`

And that should have the server run the tests and be listening on port 5000, and the frontend being served on port 3000.

It obviously needs some design work, but the data is getting through!
